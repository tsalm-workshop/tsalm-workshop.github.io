The 1st ICLR Workshop on **Time Series in the Age of Large Models (TSALM)** will be held at the Riocentro Convention and Event Center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on **April 26/27, 2026**.
We look forward to welcoming you in Rio de Janeiro.

### Introduction

Building on our [NeurIPS 2024 workshop](/neurips-2024/), this iteration focuses on key open problems in time series foundation models: context-informed predictions, reasoning and agents, interpretability, and rigorous evaluation.

While recent time series foundation models have shown promise for univariate forecasting, most practical scenarios require additional context—multivariate relationships, exogenous variables, or information from other modalities such as text. Simultaneously, LLM-powered agents are opening new possibilities for automating time series analysis workflows, though research in this area remains nascent. As these models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, understanding their inner workings and failure modes becomes critical.

The key topics of this workshop include:
- **Context-informed foundation models:** Multivariate forecasting, static and dynamic exogenous variables, multimodal time series, anomaly detection, and classification
- **Reasoning and agents:** LLM-powered agents for time series tasks, agentic scaffolds, and benchmarks for evaluating agent performance
- **Benchmarks, datasets, and tools:** Unified evaluation frameworks, large-scale and live benchmarks, synthetic data generation, and open-source libraries for pretraining and inference
- **Interpretability:** Attention analysis, feature attribution, symbolic distillation, and causal interpretability for large time series models
- **Evaluation and applications:** Metrics for probabilistic prediction, domain-specific evaluation, and applications in finance, healthcare, climate science, and dynamical systems

Please see the [Call for Papers](/call-for-papers/) for details.
