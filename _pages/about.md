The 1st ICLR Workshop on **Time Series in the Age of Large Models (TSALM)** will be held at the Riocentro Convention and Event Center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on **April 26/27, 2026**.
We look forward to welcoming you in Rio de Janeiro.

### Introduction

Foundation models have revolutionized the approach to building machine learning models in areas like natural language processing, where models are pretrained on large amounts of diverse data and then adapted for downstreams tasks, often in a _zero-shot_ fashion.
This approach has begun to gain traction in the time series community.
Recent works have developed and open-sourced foundation models for time series tasks, particularly forecasting.
Additionally, some studies have shown positive results by either leveraging pretrained models from other modalities, such as text, for time series tasks or enhancing time series analysis through exogenous information from other modalities.
These advancements have opened new research directions and challenges related to the development, analysis, evaluation, and real-world applications of large models for time series tasks.
This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to understand the progress made and push the frontier of time series research in the era of large models.

The key topics of this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Building Time Series Foundation Models
- Analysis of Pretrained Time Series Models
- Critiques on Time Series Foundation Models
- Faster and Better Inference Schemes for Autoregressive Time Series Models
- Leveraging Pretrained Models of Other Modalities for Time Series
- Multimodal Time Series Models
- Large-Scale Time Series Datasets and Benchmarks
- Time Series Evaluation
- Real-World Applications of Large Time Series Models

Please see the [Call for Papers](/call-for-papers/) for details.
